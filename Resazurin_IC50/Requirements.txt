I need a R script to analyze this resazurin cell viability assay result, I have attached the info sheet for the compounds used, have a look and see if the layout makes sense. Treat all samples as individual samples For IC50 calculations use drc package, there is a caveat with RSL3 and erastin, they should use the minimum signal from RSL3_CSE and erastin_CSE for normalisation, they themselves never reached high enough concentrations to wipe out the cells. For plots I need an interpolated logistic curve that best fits the data points. And an interpolated best fit shaded band for CI95.
